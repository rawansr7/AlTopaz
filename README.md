The project consisted of creating an e-commerce website where technical and commercial aspects were taken into account. The basic theoretical foundations have been studied (requirements, business constraints, use cases, budget plan,...), the technical specifications were designed (administration dashboard, Auth0 as an authentication provider, scoring system, recommendation system) and a prototype was developed.
